    <h1>Design Principles</h1>
    <p>
      The challenge is to develop an application that tries <br />
      to increase the user’s participation in team sports <br />
      through online communities. Several factors play <br />
      into the success of this concept. It is not possible <br />
      to achieve this goal if the application is not properly <br />
      designed. To achieve this, design principles of sev- <br />
      eral disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric <br />
      solution.

    <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
    <p>
      The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early
      1990s when he was working at Apple
      <cite>(Norman, 2013, P. XIII F.)</cite>. User experience compris- es all
      aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its
      products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to
      meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required
      between different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic
      design, industrial design, and interface design
      <cite>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.).</cite>

    <blockquote>
      <cite>
        Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part
        because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible,
        serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other
        hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.

    <p>
      User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given
      product, from the visuals, the haptics, and the audio to how the product
      feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its
      look, feel, and usability <cite>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</cite>.

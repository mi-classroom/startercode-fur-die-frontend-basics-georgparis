    <h1>Design Principles</h1>
    <p>
      The challenge is to develop an application that tries <br />
      to increase the userâ€™s participation in team sports <br />
      through online communities. Several factors play <br />
      into the success of this concept. It is not possible <br />
      to achieve this goal if the application is not properly <br />
      designed. To achieve this, design principles of sev- <br />
      eral disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric <br />
      solution.
